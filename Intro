Power BI Desktop
   -> Get Data -> Analyse -> Visualize -> Publish -> Collaborate
  Power Query Editor --> called as Heart Of Power BI
     where we can add or merge queries(files or sources) used for transformation like cleaning, shaping, combining various sources
        -- Data Profiling Tools include i)Column Quality ii)Column Distribution iii)Column Profile
        -- Group By Dialog -> usage group by dialog may be slow bi as it consumes space , so directly through visualiztions we can do it.
        -- Applied Steps -> any changes done are logged or noted in this, rename the steps helps a  lot to identify
        -- Appending(adding rows to existing columns) & Merging(combining 2 tables based on similiar condition) 
  DAX(Data Analysis Expressions)
        2 Business Logics
         ....Measures(value->gives 1  like sum(col))
         ....Calculated Columns(adding column for each row)
       Implicit Measures==> if we use a calculated column as value/result,it creates an implicit measure
       DAX :::: is all about Data Analysis Expressions and Aggregation/Filtering 
                 Aggregation :::>combining group of values into a single value.  Eg:Sum, Avg, Max, Min, Distinct Count
                       (Always validate your aggreated in excel or sql)
                             :::>Date Functions
