POWER BI
  1)Power BI Desktop=>To create reports
  2)Power BI Service(SaaS)=>To share and collobarate, this is on cloud
  3)Power BI Mobile Apps=> can view the reports only, no editing
Power BI Desktop
   -> Get Data -> Analyse -> Visualize -> Publish -> Collaborate
  Power Query Editor --> called as Heart Of Power BI
     where we can add or merge queries(files or sources) used for transformation like cleaning, shaping, combining various sources
        -- Data Profiling Tools include i)Column Quality ii)Column Distribution iii)Column Profile
        -- Group By Dialog -> usage group by dialog may be slow bi as it consumes space , so directly through visualiztions we can do it.
        -- Applied Steps -> any changes done are logged or noted in this, rename the steps helps a  lot to identify
        -- Appending(adding rows to existing columns) & Merging(combining 2 tables based on similiar condition) 
  DAX(Data Analysis Expressions)
        2 Business Logics
         ....Measures(value->gives 1  like sum(col))==>created on tabular basis entire table
         ....Calculated Columns(adding column for each row)==>calculated columns calculated on row level
             2 Contexts
                i)Row Contexts is related to calculated columns ii)Filter Contexts is related to measures
       Implicit Measures==> if we use a calculated column as value/result,it creates an implicit measure
       DAX :::: is all about Data Analysis Expressions and Aggregation/Filtering 
                 Aggregation :::>combining group of values into a single value.  Eg:Sum, Avg, Max, Min, Distinct Count
                       (Always validate your aggreated in excel or sql)
                             :::>Date Functions ---DateDiff,AddDate
                             :::>CalenderFunctions->create a table with one column range b/w 2 dates
                                    NewTable = Calender(Date(1949,1,1),Date(1950,12,31)
                                    YearNumber = Year(NewTable[Date])
                                    MonthNumber = Month(NewTable[Date])
                                    MonthName = Format(NewTable[Date],'MMM')
                                    DayOfWeek = WeekDay(NewTable[Date])
                         Imp Dax Fn :::>Calculate & Filter
                                  By creating new measures we can find total_monthly_charges by gender male or female in 2 ways: Calculate alone & Calculate + Filter  
                                  1Q) Find the total_monthly_charges by gender male by Calculate Fn
                                       Calculate(Sum(TableName[Monthly_charges]),TableName[Gender]=='male')
                                       Calculate Fn can be used for same table filtering whereas for diff tables grouping it doesn't work then we use filter where both table are linked each by primary key.
                                  2Q) Find the total_monthly_charges by gender female by Filter Fn
                                        Calculate(Sum(TableName[Monthly_charges]),Filter(TableName,TableName[Gender]=='male'
                      If Else and Nested If:
                              1st Way by DAX==>recommended in this way only
                                  To add any bins or groups and mention as other ref we use if else if..
                                  We create a table view with some required columns and add a new calculated column withh if condition
                                   If-else     =If(TableName[Age]<18,"Not Eligible","Eligible")
                                   If-else-if  =If(TableName[Age]<=19,"Teen",If(TableName[Age]<=50,"Adults","Old"))

                                  Transform data > Add Column > Conditional Column
                      Time Intelligence Functions:
                          enables users to manipulate data using time periods such as years, quarters, months, days
